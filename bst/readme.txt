BINARY SEARCH TREE:

This project is not an attempt to reinvent the wheel.
I wanted some practice with C++ and decided to write a bunch of code that
could randomly generate BSTs, copy, delete, etc, all while using the best 
practices possible.

Best practices include:
- never passing a class object by value
- using keyword 'const' to protect class data
- encapsulation using protected classes


OBJECTIVES:
[x] build a BST
[x] delete a BST
[ ] build a randomly generated BST
[ ] create a copy of a BST
[x] insert into a BST
[x] display contents of a BST
[x] count number of nodes
[x] count number of leaves
[ ] calculate height
[ ] implement a balancing algorithm
[ ] add operator overloading
[ ] create a more robust node structure and import data from an API
[ ] create visualization of the BST


RUNNING IT:

There are multiple source files, a header file and a makefile file for 
this program. 

From the command line, simply type "make" and then "./play".

To recompile after making changes, type "make" again.
To delete all executables, type "make clean".

That's it!
Hope you enjoy my silly program.
